## Description
***[Explain the Data Structure in your own words]***

A C# implementation of a `Singly Linked List`. Singly Linked Lists contain individual nodes that have a reference to the `Next` node in the list as well as a `Value`. The methods of this `Linked List` are `Insert`, `Includes` and `ToString`.

## Methods

| Method | Summary | Big O Time | Big O Space | Example | 
| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| Insert | Adds a new `Node` to the `Linked List` | O(1) | O(1) | myList.Insert(99) |
| Includes | Takes in a value and returns a boolean depending on if the value is in the `LinkedList` | O(n) | O(1) | myList.Includes(99) |

## Visuals
***[TBA]***

### Insert Method

*The Insert Method takes in an int as a parameter. A new Node is then created using the* 
*int param as its Value. The new Node is then placed in the Linked List at the Head and*
*the previous Head is assigned as the new Nodes Next.*

### Includes Method

*The Includes Method takes in an int as a parameter then iterates through the Nodes of the*
*Linked List checking all the Values. If the value is found True is returned, if not then*
*False is returned.*
