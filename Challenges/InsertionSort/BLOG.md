# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) *one item at a time*. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. For small data sets insertion sort provides several advantages: 
* It is a simple implementation. 
* It is more efficient than other simple quadratic algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort. 
* It is adaptive, meaning, it is efficient for data sets are already somewhat sorted.
* It is stable and does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.
* It is done in-place and only requires O(1) of additional memory space.
* It is online and can sort a list as it is received.
