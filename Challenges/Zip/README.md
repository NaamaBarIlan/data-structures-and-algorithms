## Description

A C# implementation of a `Singly Linked List`. Singly Linked Lists contain individual nodes that have a reference to the `Next` node in the list as well as a `Value`. The methods of this `Linked List` are `Insert`, `Includes`, `ToString`, `Append`, `FindKthFromEnd`, and `ZipLists`.

| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| ZipLists | Takes two linked lists as arguments, zips them together into one, so that the nodes alternate between the two lists, and returns a reference to the head of the zipped list | O(n) | O(n) | myList.ZipLists(99) |

### Zip Lists Method

* The Zip Lists Method Takes two linked lists as arguments, zips the two linked lists together into one, so that the nodes alternate between the two lists, and returns a reference to the head of the zipped list. This method has access to the Node class and all the properties and methods of the Linked List class.
