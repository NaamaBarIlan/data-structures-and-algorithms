## Binary Tree Paths
*Author: Na'ama Bar-Ilan*

---

### Problem Domain

* Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.
* Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

---

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

```
Input:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

```

---

### Big O


| Efficiency  | Big O |  |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |  :----------- |
| Time |  O(n)  | This is because we will be traversing over the entire tree, visiting every node |
| Space| O(n) | This is because we are instantiating a list that will grow as the size of the input grows |
